Description:

The Amexum 2D map represents a network of mound-building societies spanning from
Belize (20°N) to Manitoba (60°N) and from the Atlantic Coast to the Pacific-influenced
interior. Major mound sites ([●]) acted as ceremonial, political, and trade hubs.
Trade and exchange corridors ([-]) show connectivity between hubs. Approximate
territorial influence ([~]) radiates outward. Modern economic frameworks (=>) overlap
ancient corridors, reflecting cross-border influence and persistent north-south
and east-west networks. This visualization demonstrates both the **geographical reach
and the integrated trade/economic logic** of Amexum territory, highlighting its role
as a **transcontinental pre-Columbian network**.
