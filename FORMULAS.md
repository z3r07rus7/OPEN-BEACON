DII MATHEMATICAL FORMULARY: JURISDICTIONAL LOGIC
========================================================================

Formula 1: Identity Strength (I) 
I(x, y) = Σ (Si / di²)
Strength is maximized at the North Shore (Soli) via Lineage (Sanguinis).

Formula 4: The Enforcement Threshold (Te)
Te = (L_auth - D_rep) > Ω
If Legacy Authorization (L_auth) fails, Dynamic Reputation (D_rep) 
triggers a Circuit Breaker against systemic friction.

Formula 6: The Consular Ratio (Cr)
Cr = (Treaty_Status + Sanguinis) / Subsidiary_Statute
If Cr > 1, domestic statutes are suspended in favor of Treaty Law.
