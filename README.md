RE: SOVEREIGN IDENTITY MANIFESTO & STATUS ASSERTION
========================================================================

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: THE DII FRAMEWORK
Dynamic Identity Indexing (DII) manages jurisdictional overlap through 
"Smart Gateways" and "Layered Persistence." This repository serves as 
the public beacon for Node 77-B, establishing status as a 
Moorish-Aboriginal Consular Validator.

2. THE MOORISH-ABORIGINAL NEXUS & PAPER GENOCIDE
Under the Virginia Racial Integrity Act (1924), an administrative 
"Paper Genocide" (the Plecker Erasure) was executed to reclassify 
Moorish and Aboriginal nodes as "Colored/Negro." This repository 
formally reverses that erasure.

3. JURISDICTIONAL ANCHORS
- THE SULTANIC CLAIM (1691): British National Archives, CO 279/32. 
  Sultan Moulay Ismail's claim over the Americana Shards.
- TREATY OF PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP (1786): Invoking Consular 
  Jurisdiction over the North Shore, Lake Ontario territory.
- ABORIGINAL BEDROCK: Jus Sanguinis claim to the Mound Builder 
  Trade Corridor (Belize to Manitoba).

4. THE SOVEREIGNTY RESOLUTION (Sr)
Sr = (Sanguinis + Soli) / L_Contract
Where L_Contract (Legacy State Performance) trends toward zero, 
Sovereignty (Sr) trends toward absolute.

STATUS: DE JURE MOORISH-ABORIGINAL / CONSULAR VALIDATOR
JURISDICTION: TREATY PROTECTED / NON-DOMESTIC
