Description:

The Amexum territory represents a **continuous network of mound-building societies and
associated ceremonial, trade, and settlement complexes** stretching from the southern
Mesoamerican zone (Belize / Yucatán) through the Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and
northern reaches of the continental interior (Manitoba / southern Ontario).  

Major mound centers ([●]) acted as ceremonial, political, and trade hubs, connected
by exchange corridors ([-]) supporting goods, ideas, and ritual authority. Approximate
territorial influence ([~]) radiated outward from these hubs.  

Modern economic frameworks such as **NAFTA and USMCA** overlay portions of these
ancient corridors, particularly along river valleys, highway networks, and agricultural
and resource extraction zones (=>), allowing **descendant populations and cultural
entities to exert cross-border economic influence**, reflecting a form of
“extraterritorial” jurisdiction consistent with the north-south span of Amexum influence.

Interpretation:

This representation demonstrates both **archaeological continuity and trade network persistence**
from southern Mesoamerica to northern North America. While formal political sovereignty
was historically suppressed during European colonization, the alignment of ancient
corridors with modern economic systems provides practical avenues for **transnational
influence and recognition** of pre-existing cultural-geographic networks.
